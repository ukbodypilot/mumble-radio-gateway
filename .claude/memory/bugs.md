# Bug History — Mumble Radio Gateway

## Audio Pipeline Bugs
- **SDR-to-SDR ducking inconsistency / sources switching over each other** (commit 3808066): Rule 2 (higher-priority SDR ducks lower-priority SDR) used `check_signal_instant()` — zero attack, fires on any chunk above -50 dBFS including SDR noise floor. Also checked `sig or hold` for `other_has_signal`, meaning a single noisy 200ms chunk from SDR1 silenced SDR2 for 3s via the hold timer. With intermittent SDR noise both sources flipped rapidly. Fixed: `_sdr_trace['sig']` now stores `has_actual_audio()` result (requires `SIGNAL_ATTACK_TIME=0.15s` continuous signal before firing); Rule 2 reads only `sig` — `hold` is for inclusion/fade-out only, not ducking decisions. Release unchanged at 3s.
- **SDR burst/choppy audio**: `frames_per_buffer=153600` (16× chunk) caused ALSA DMA to fire every 3.2s. Fixed to `AUDIO_CHUNK_SIZE` (9600 = 200ms).
- **Pop at SDR onset**: Old 0.1s attack timer dropped first chunk. Fixed: instant-attack (`check_signal_instant`, -50dB) + 10ms fade-in.
- **Pop at SDR offset (timing-window bug)**: Fade-out triggered by `(hold_until - current_time) < chunk_dur` — missed when AIOC read took >200ms. Fixed: transition-based fade-out when `prev_included` flips False.
- **SDR gated on AIOC failures**: Mixer was inside AIOC gate. Fixed: mixer runs unconditionally; AIOC errors absorbed in `get_audio()`.
- **Sequential double-blocking (400ms loop)**: AIOC 200ms + SDR 200ms in same thread. Fixed: SDR background reader thread, `get_audio()` is non-blocking queue pop.
- **GIL contention causing ALSA overruns**: Reader thread did numpy between reads, competing with main loop. Fixed: reader thread does read+append only; all processing in main thread.
- **Mumble encoder starvation**: `data is None → continue` skipped `add_sound()`. Opus resets across gaps. Fixed: substitute silence, fall through to `add_sound()`.
- **duck-out regression (all audio broken)**: `sdr_active_at_transition` used `check_signal_instant` on raw loopback — always True with SDR app running, silencing first 1s of every AIOC transmission. Fixed: use `sdr_prev_included` instead.
- **SDR audio drops (periodic gaps every ~800ms)**: SDRSource.get_audio() had no cushion-rebuild mechanism — after sub_buffer depleted it served immediately from the next blob, giving zero margin against ALSA jitter. AIOCRadioSource has a `_prebuffering` gate that refuses to serve until 3 full blobs accumulate after any depletion; SDR lacked this entirely. Also: drain only ran when sub_buffer < cb (not every tick), so the cushion never grew. Fixed: always-drain every tick + `_prebuffering` gate identical to AIOC. Also added `_blob_bytes` (chunk_bytes × buffer_multiplier), reader blob timestamp deque (`_blob_times`), SDR2 queue/sub_buffer visibility in trace, and all-ticks trace output. Verified: zero silence gaps in trace, prebuffering fires correctly ~1–2× per trace when ALSA reader stalls >500ms, other SDR covers during rebuild.
- **SDR2 duck-through on SDR1 buffer gaps**: SDR-to-SDR duck check iterated `sdrs_to_include` (only sources with actual audio data). When SDR1's buffer ran dry between bursty deliveries, SDR1 wasn't in `sdrs_to_include` (get_audio returned None → `continue` at line 1942), so SDR2 didn't see SDR1's active hold timer and played through. Fixed: iterate `sorted_sdrs` (all processed SDRs) instead, checking `_sdr_trace` which is populated even when audio is None.
- **AIOC audio output stale state**: AIOC USB audio output gets stuck after extended runtime or PipeWire/WirePlumber interaction — PTT keys radio via HID but no audio reaches radio. `speaker-test -D hw:N,0` also produces no audio. Not a software bug — hardware state issue. Fixed: added USB reset (sysfs authorized cycle) to start.sh step 3.

## Status Bar / UI Bugs
- **SDR2 failure shown as silent (indistinguishable)**: When SDR2 `setup_audio()` returns False, object kept with `enabled=False` but status bar checked only `if self.sdr2_source:` — showed `SDR2:[----------] 0%` identical to a working-but-silent source. Fixed: gate on `self.sdr2_source.enabled` so failed/disabled SDR2 is omitted from status bar.
- **SDR2 error message hardcoded `hw:4,1`**: Warning on init failure always printed the default device name regardless of config. Fixed: use `self.config.SDR2_DEVICE_NAME`.
- **SDR2 init leftover debug prints**: Two unconditional prints dumping `SDR2_DEVICE_NAME from config:` and `SDR2_PRIORITY from config:` were not guarded by VERBOSE_LOGGING. Removed.
- **Announcement/PTT keys spam errors without AIOC**: Pressing 0-9 or 'p' without AIOC queued file playback → `set_ptt_state()` printed "[PTT] No AIOC device available!" every 50ms tick because it returned without setting `ptt_active`, causing re-trigger. Fixed: keyboard handler rejects keys when `aioc_device` is absent; `set_ptt_state` silently returns.
- **Status bar width shift on mute/duck**: Muted/ducked bars were 10 visible chars vs normal bars at 11. Fixed: padded M/D suffix to 4 chars (`M   ` / `D   `).
- **PTT trace always showed RMS=0**: The RMS measurement point in audio_transmit_loop was after the PTT branch `continue`, so it never executed for PTT ticks. Trace showed RMS=0 for all file playback/announcement ticks, making it look like silence was being sent. Fixed: added RMS measurement inside the PTT branch itself.

## Config / Code Bugs
- **Config parser crash on decimal**: `int('0.3')` raised ValueError, silently abandoning all config after that line. Fixed: `VAD_RELEASE: 1.0` default (float); parser tries `float()` fallback on ValueError.
- **global_muted UnboundLocalError**: Set inside `if self.sdr_source:` block, used in `if self.sdr2_source:` block. Fixed: calculated before both blocks.
- **NetworkAnnouncementSource missing muted check**: `get_audio()` checked `self.enabled` but not `self.muted`, so pressing 'a' to mute wouldn't stop audio flow. Fixed: added `self.muted` check.

## Installer Bugs
- **numlids=3 silently ignored on Debian**: RPi kernel param, not standard. Fixed: `enable=1,1,1 index=4,5,6`.
- **Loopback card count wrong**: `grep -c "Loopback"` counted 2 lines per card. Fixed: count `device 0` lines only.
- **Installer aborted at step 5**: `set -e` + `sudo tee /etc/security/limits.d/...` failed (dir missing on minimal Debian). Fixed: `set +e` around step 5, `sudo mkdir -p` first.
- **darkice.cfg never created**: Path pointed to `examples/darkice.cfg.example` but file is in `scripts/`. Fixed.
- **DarkIce 1.5 parser crash**: Word "password" in comment before first `[section]` header → "no current section" crash. Fixed: removed from comment text.
- **WirePlumber locks loopback to S32_LE**: DarkIce needs S16_LE. Fixed: WirePlumber rule disabling `alsa_card.platform-snd_aloop.*`.
- **WirePlumber hides AIOC from PyAudio**: Fixed: WirePlumber rule disabling `alsa_card.usb-AIOC_*`.
- **AIOC hidraw inaccessible**: udev rule only covered `SUBSYSTEM=="usb"`, not `SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw"`. PTT HID access requires hidraw. Fixed: added hidraw rule.
- **Wrong Python HID package**: Installer installed `hidapi`; gateway uses `hid.Device` from `hid` package. Fixed.
- **pymumble-py3 SSL broken on Python 3.12+**: `ssl.wrap_socket` removed, `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` deprecated. Fixed: monkey-patch before import.
